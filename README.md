# Playground

This project was built using Angular, Bulma, PrimeNG and Bootstrap. 

This project was created for practice and further exploration of the technologies I have already worked with. Creating apps which interest me that have a practical use to my everyday life.

## Postcrossing

I really enjoy Postcrossing and started to recreate the app and make my adjustments in how I want to view data and add more data. 

## Books

Reading is another favorite hobby. This section is dedicated to the books I want to read. My neverending TBR lists and my love for checking the books of my list as complete. 

## New App
I eventually want to transform this application to support microservices and I see this as a playground to explore my ideas. 

<!-- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. -->
